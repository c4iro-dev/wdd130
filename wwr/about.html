                <p>At Joy-Adventure Rafting, our purpose is to bring people closer to nature through the thrill of whitewater. We believe
                that every trip down the river is more than just an adventure—it’s a chance to build teamwork, create memories, and find
                joy in the outdoors. With safety at the heart of what we do, we guide rafters of all ages and skill levels to experience
                the rush of the rapids while fostering respect for the rivers we call home.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Joy-Adventure Rafting began in 1998 when two friends, both lifelong river enthusiasts, decided to share their love of
            whitewater with others. What started as weekend trips on the local river quickly grew into a small outfitter known for
            its welcoming spirit and safe, exhilarating journeys. Over the years, Joy-Adventure has expanded its routes and team,
            but it has never lost its original mission: to turn every paddle stroke into a moment of joy and adventure for rafters
            of all ages.</p>
